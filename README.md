2) Palindrome Detection
 
Create an html page with an input field and a button to determine if the input field contains a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is spelled exactly the same forwards or backwards, like "pop" or "Ah, Satan sees Natasha".  Your code should ignore all non-alphanumeric characters and assume that upper-and lower-case characters are identical.   When the button is pressed the the result of whether or not the input is a palindrome should be displayed.
